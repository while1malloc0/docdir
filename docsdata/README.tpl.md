# docdir

A small tool for summarizing directory structures

## Introduction

`docdir` prints a Unix `tree`-esque representation of a directory structure, but with each folder annotated with a description.

## Quickstart

Running `docdir` on an empty directory with no description files will simply print the name of the directory.
[embedmd]:# (../e2e/testdata/simple.ct shell)

Any subdirectories will be printed a-la `tree`.
[embedmd]:# (../e2e/testdata/nested.ct shell)

If a `DESCRIPTION` file is found, the first sentence of that file will be printed.
[embedmd]:# (../e2e/testdata/nested-description.ct shell)

By default, any subdirectories without descriptions will still be printed.
[embedmd]:# (../e2e/testdata/mixed-description.ct shell)
